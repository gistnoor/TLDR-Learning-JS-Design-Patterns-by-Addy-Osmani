# Flyweight Pattern

### TL;DR

The Flyweight pattern is a classical structural solution for optimizing code that is repetitive, slow and inefficiently shares data. It aims to minimize the use of memory in an application by sharing as much data as possible with related objects (e.g application configuration, state and so on).

### Flyweight's State Concepts
- **Intrinsic** - Intrinsic information may be required by internal methods in our objects which they absolutely cannot function without
- **Extrinsic** - Extrinsic information can however be removed and stored externally.

Next, let's continue our look at Flyweights by implementing a system to manage all of the books in a library.

```javascript
var Book = function( id, title, author, genre, pageCount,publisherID, ISBN, checkoutDate, checkoutMember, dueReturnDate,availability ){

   this.id = id;
   this.title = title;
   this.author = author;
   this.genre = genre;
   this.pageCount = pageCount;
   this.publisherID = publisherID;
   this.ISBN = ISBN;
   this.checkoutDate = checkoutDate;
   this.checkoutMember = checkoutMember;
   this.dueReturnDate = dueReturnDate;
   this.availability = availability;

};

Book.prototype = {

  getTitle: function () {
     return this.title;
  },

  getAuthor: function () {
     return this.author;
  },

  getISBN: function (){
     return this.ISBN;
  },

  // For brevity, other getters are not shown
  updateCheckoutStatus: function( bookID, newStatus, checkoutDate, checkoutMember, newReturnDate ){

     this.id = bookID;
     this.availability = newStatus;
     this.checkoutDate = checkoutDate;
     this.checkoutMember = checkoutMember;
     this.dueReturnDate = newReturnDate;

  },

  extendCheckoutPeriod: function( bookID, newReturnDate ){

      this.id = bookID;
      this.dueReturnDate = newReturnDate;

  },

  isPastDue: function(bookID){

     var currentDate = new Date();
     return currentDate.getTime() > Date.parse( this.dueReturnDate );

   }
};
```

This probably works fine initially for small collections of books, however as the library expands to include a larger inventory with multiple versions and copies of each book available, we may find the management system running slower and slower over time.

We can now separate our data into intrinsic and extrinsic states as follows: data relevant to the book object (`title`, `author`, etc) is intrinsic whilst the checkout data (`checkoutMember`, `dueReturnDate`, etc) is considered extrinsic.

```javascript
// Flyweight optimized version
var Book = function ( title, author, genre, pageCount, publisherID, ISBN ) {

    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.genre = genre;
    this.pageCount = pageCount;
    this.publisherID = publisherID;
    this.ISBN = ISBN;

};
```

As we can see, the extrinsic states have been removed. Everything to do with library check-outs will be moved to a manager and as the object data is now segmented, a factory can be used for instantiation.

*A basic Factory*
```javascript
// Book Factory singleton
var BookFactory = (function () {
  var existingBooks = {}, existingBook;

  return {
    createBook: function ( title, author, genre, pageCount, publisherID, ISBN ) {

      // Find out if a particular book meta-data combination has been created before
      // !! or (bang bang) forces a boolean to be returned
      existingBook = existingBooks[ISBN];
      if ( !!existingBook ) {
        return existingBook;
      } else {

        // if not, let's create a new instance of the book and store it
        var book = new Book( title, author, genre, pageCount, publisherID, ISBN );
        existingBooks[ISBN] = book;
        return book;

      }
    }
  };

})();
```

*Managing the Extrinsic States*
```javascript
// BookRecordManager singleton
var BookRecordManager = (function () {

  var bookRecordDatabase = {};

  return {
    // add a new book into the library system
    addBookRecord: function ( id, title, author, genre, pageCount, publisherID, ISBN, checkoutDate, checkoutMember, dueReturnDate, availability ) {

      var book = BookFactory.createBook( title, author, genre, pageCount, publisherID, ISBN );

      bookRecordDatabase[id] = {
        checkoutMember: checkoutMember,
        checkoutDate: checkoutDate,
        dueReturnDate: dueReturnDate,
        availability: availability,
        book: book
      };
    },
    updateCheckoutStatus: function ( bookID, newStatus, checkoutDate, checkoutMember, newReturnDate ) {

      var record = bookRecordDatabase[bookID];
      record.availability = newStatus;
      record.checkoutDate = checkoutDate;
      record.checkoutMember = checkoutMember;
      record.dueReturnDate = newReturnDate;
    },

    extendCheckoutPeriod: function ( bookID, newReturnDate ) {
      bookRecordDatabase[bookID].dueReturnDate = newReturnDate;
    },

    isPastDue: function ( bookID ) {
      var currentDate = new Date();
      return currentDate.getTime() > Date.parse( bookRecordDatabase[bookID].dueReturnDate );
    }
  };

})();
```

The result of these changes is that all of the data that's been extracted from the Book class is now being stored in an attribute of the BookManager singleton (BookDatabase) - something considerably more efficient than the large number of objects we were previously using. Methods related to book checkouts are also now based here as they deal with data that's extrinsic rather than intrinsic.
